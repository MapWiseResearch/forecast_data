# forecast_data

CSV outputs generated during MapWiseResearch forecasting workflows.

This repository contains **usable but non-standardized** data outputs produced during model development and forecast generation. Files are primarily intended for **internal use, visualization (e.g. Datawrapper), and archival reference**, rather than as a polished public dataset.

This repository is published publicly **in the interest of transparency** and reflects the MapWiseResearch / MapWisePolitics division’s commitment to **open, freely accessible data** as a means of improving public understanding and accountability, even when the underlying data is complex.

## Contents

- **[`22and24`](./22and24)**  
  Forecast-related CSV outputs for the **2022 and 2024 federal election cycles**.  
  These files were produced **before MapWisePolitics existed in its current form**, during earlier iterations of the project. They are preserved for historical reference, validation, and transparency.

- **[`25governors`](./25governors)**  
  Forecast-related CSV outputs for **2025 gubernatorial elections**.  
  **This directory is no longer maintained.** The election cycle has concluded, and forecasts were not run through election day. Files are preserved solely for archival and transparency purposes.

- **[`26midterms`](./26midterms)**  
  Forecast-related CSV outputs for **2026 U.S. midterm election forecasts**.  
  This directory may continue to receive updates as forecasts evolve.

- **[`chambercontrol.csv`](chambercontrol.csv)**  
  Summary CSV tracking **overall forecast performance** from **2022 onward**.  
  This file compares **predicted vs actual outcomes** for major federal races and serves as the project’s long-term accuracy record.

Files may differ in schema, naming conventions, and level of preprocessing depending on the modeling context in which they were produced.

## Usage Notes

- Data is **functional but complex**, with minimal abstraction  
- Column definitions and formats are not fully standardized  
- Some files reflect intermediate or snapshot outputs  
- Assumes familiarity with election data and forecasting workflows  
- No guarantees of completeness, consistency, or long-term stability  

Users should inspect files directly before downstream use.

## Purpose

This repository exists to:
- Preserve snapshot outputs from forecasting models  
- Support downstream visualization tools  
- Enable public transparency into forecasting outputs  
- Maintain an accessible archive of historical forecast states
