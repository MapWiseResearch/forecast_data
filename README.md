# forecast_data

CSV outputs generated during MapWiseResearch forecasting workflows.

This repository contains **usable but non-standardized** data outputs produced during model development and forecast generation. Files are primarily intended for **internal use, visualization (e.g. Datawrapper), and archival reference**, rather than as a polished public dataset.

This repository is published publicly **in the interest of transparency** and reflects the MapWiseResearch / MapWisePolitics division’s commitment to **open, freely accessible data** as a means of improving public understanding and accountability, even when the underlying data is complex.

- Column definitions and formats are not fully standardized  
- Some files reflect intermediate or snapshot outputs  
- Assumes familiarity with election data and forecasting workflows  

Users should inspect files directly before downstream use.

## Purpose

This repository exists to:
- Preserve snapshot outputs from forecasting models  
- Support downstream visualization tools  
- Enable public transparency into forecasting outputs  
- Maintain an accessible archive of historical forecast states
