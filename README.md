# forecast_data

CSV outputs generated during MapWiseResearch forecasting workflows.

This repository contains **usable but non-standardized** data outputs produced during model development and forecast generation. Files are primarily intended for **internal use, visualization (e.g. Datawrapper), and archival reference**, rather than as a polished public dataset.

This repository is published publicly **in the interest of transparency** and reflects the MapWiseResearch / MapWisePolitics division’s commitment to **open, freely accessible data** as a means of improving public understanding and accountability, even when the underlying data is complex.

## Contents

- **[`25governors`](./25governors)**  
  Forecast-related CSV outputs for 2025 gubernatorial elections.  
  **This directory is no longer maintained.** The election cycle has concluded, and forecasts were not run through election day. Files are preserved solely for archival and transparency purposes.

- **[`26midterms`](./26midterms)**  
  Forecast-related CSV outputs for 2026 U.S. midterm election forecasts.  
  This directory may continue to receive updates as forecasts evolve.

Files may differ in schema, naming conventions, and level of preprocessing depending on the modeling context in which they were produced.

## Usage Notes

- Data is **functional but complex**, with minimal abstraction  
- Column definitions and formats are not fully standardized  
- Some files reflect intermediate or snapshot outputs  
- Assumes familiarity with election data and forecasting workflows  
- No guarantees of completeness, consistency, or long-term stability  

Users should inspect files directly before downstream use.

## Purpose

This repository exists to:
- Preserve snapshot outputs from forecasting models  
- Support downstream visualization tools  
- Enable public transparency into forecasting outputs  
- Maintain an accessible archive of historical forecast states
